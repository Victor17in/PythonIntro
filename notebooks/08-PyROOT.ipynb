    "# PyROOT\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, this tutorial has been quite generic. This part is for particle physics students.\n",
    "\n",
    "pyROOT is a Python extension module which provides bindings for all classes within the ROOT libraries and is easily used in unison with C++. Whereas the ROOTpy project provides a more pythonic interface with ROOT on top of the PyROOT bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of these exercises is to obtain a general understanding of the syntax required to import and make use of the ROOT libraries within a basic Python script as well as to illustrate how to make use of C++ classes in order to save computing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you use Python, C++ or some combination of the two to complete your analysis is a personal preference, however with the current lack of documentation on pyROOT, many students stick with C++ in order to ensure their access to coding examples and experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful chap has wrapped up the entirety of ROOT into a python module. Since python syntax is more natural than C++ and the python interpreter does not suffer from as many bugs and problems with non-standard syntax as the 'CINT' interpreter, I recommend using pyROOT instead of CINT when you are starting any program from scratch. People may suggest that python is slower than C++. It is, but that statement applies to compiled C++ not CINT, for the most part it doesn't matter and also you need to know C++ well to make it very fast. At the end of the day, any really slow parts of your code can be re-written in C(++) if absolutely necessary. Remember two generalizations about C++ and general execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The average C++ software engineer writes 6 lines of useful, fully tested and debugged code per day.\n",
    " 2. 80% of the CPU time will be spent on 20% of your code even after you have optimised the slow parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets begin by setting up root. To use pyROOT, the C++ libraries must be on your PYTHONPATH."

    "Lets now import the ROOT module into root and use it to draw a simple histogram."
